## About the Game  
GUESS_Fi_Fun😊 is a minimal yet engaging terminal game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a fixed number of attempts. It’s inspired by classic “Guess the Number” logic games, great for beginners learning loops, input validation, and conditional branching in any programming language.  

## Game Rules  
- The computer picks a secret integer in a predefined range (by default 1 to 100).  
- The player enters a guess.  
- After each guess, feedback is shown:
  - **Too high** → “▼”  
  - **Too low** → “▲”  
  - **Correct** → “✔”  
- The game ends when the player guesses correctly or uses up all attempts.
