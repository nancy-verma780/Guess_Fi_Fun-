## What I Learned

Developing this game helped me solidify my understanding of:

- The `random` module for generating random numbers.
- Working with user input and converting it to the desired data type (integer in this case).
- Utilizing conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) for decision making.
- Implementing loops (`while`) for repetitive tasks.
- Displaying formatted output using `print` statements.
